Now that the foundation and authentication are complete, let's build the user-facing dashboard and core features of HealthBuddy. The design should maintain the modern and minimal aesthetic.

1. Dashboard Layout (app/dashboard/layout.tsx):



Develop a dashboard layout with a persistent sidebar for navigation and a main content area.

The sidebar should include links to "Dashboard," "Personalized Plans," "Daily Tracking," and "Mental Wellness."

2. Dashboard Home (app/dashboard/page.tsx):



This page will be the user's main hub, providing a summary of their daily health data.

Include components to display:

Today's calorie intake.

Daily exercise log.

Latest weight and mental state entries.

3. Database and ORM Setup:



Set up a PostgreSQL database (e.g., using Supabase).

Install and configure the Prisma ORM.

Define the database schema in prisma/schema.prisma to include models for User, CalorieLog, ExerciseLog, WeightLog, and MentalStateLog.

4. Daily Tracking (app/dashboard/tracking/page.tsx):



Create intuitive forms for users to log:

Calorie intake.

Exercise activities.

Weight and height.

Mental state (using a simple selection and an optional journal entry).

Develop Next.js API routes to handle form submissions and use Prisma to save the data to the PostgreSQL database.

5. Personalized Plans Page (app/dashboard/plans/page.tsx):



Design a page where users can input their preferences, goals, and other data to generate personalized plans.

Include sections for Meal Plans, Exercise Routines, and Recreational Activities.

For now, the "Generate" buttons can return static, placeholder data.

6. AI Mental Wellness Companion (app/dashboard/wellness/page.tsx):



Create a chat interface that resembles modern AI assistants.

Implement the frontend chat functionality, including state management for the conversation.

Set up a Next.js API route (app/api/chat/route.ts) that will receive user messages and, for now, return a predefined static response to simulate the AI
