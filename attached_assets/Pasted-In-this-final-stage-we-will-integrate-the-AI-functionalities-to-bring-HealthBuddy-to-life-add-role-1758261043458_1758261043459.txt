In this final stage, we will integrate the AI functionalities to bring HealthBuddy to life, add role-based features, and finalize the application for deployment.

1. AI Integration with LangChain.js:

Personalized Plans:

Replace the placeholder data in the "Personalized Plans" feature with real API calls to an AI model (e.g., OpenAI via OpenRouter).

Use LangChain.js in your API routes to construct detailed prompts based on user input to generate tailored meal and exercise plans.

AI Symptom Checker:

Create a new page at app/dashboard/symptom-checker/page.tsx with an input for symptoms.

Develop an API route that uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with a medical knowledge base stored in a vector database (Supabase pgvector).

The AI should provide a basic analysis, lifestyle advice, and a recommendation for professional consultation. Crucially, add a clear disclaimer that this is not a substitute for medical advice.

AI Mental Wellness Companion:

Enhance the app/api/chat/route.ts to use a RAG pipeline.

Populate the vector database with mental wellness resources to enable the AI to provide empathetic and context-aware support.

2. Health Reports (app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx):

Create a page for users to view their weekly or monthly health reports.

Fetch tracking data from the database and use a charting library like Recharts to visualize progress.

Optionally, use an AI call to generate a text summary and recommendations based on the data.

3. Role-Based Access and Professional Features:

Update the Prisma schema to include user roles (END_USER, HEALTHCARE_PROFESSIONAL, ADMIN).

Implement Next.js middleware to protect routes based on these roles.

Create a dashboard for healthcare professionals (app/professional/dashboard/page.tsx) to view anonymized or user-shared health reports and AI-generated risk factor summaries.

4. Admin Features and Deployment:

Build a simple admin dashboard (app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx) to display platform usage statistics and manage users.

Polish the entire application's UI with subtle animations using Framer Motion.

Implement comprehensive error handling.

Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.

Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application, preparing it for deployment on platforms like Vercel and Azure."
