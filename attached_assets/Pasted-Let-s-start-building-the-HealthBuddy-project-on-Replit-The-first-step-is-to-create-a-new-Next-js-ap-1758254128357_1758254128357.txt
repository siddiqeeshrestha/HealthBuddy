Let's start building the HealthBuddy project on Replit. The first step is to create a new Next.js application and set up the fundamental structure and styling. The design should be modern and minimal, inspired by platforms like ChatGPT or Gemini, featuring a clean layout and a simple color scheme without gradients.

1. Project Initialization & Structure:

Create a new Next.js project in Replit.

Organize the project with the following directory structure:

app/ for application routes.

components/ for reusable UI elements.

lib/ for utility functions, including Firebase configuration.

public/ for static assets.

styles/ for global CSS.

2. Styling with Tailwind CSS:

Install and configure Tailwind CSS.

Define a minimal color palette in tailwind.config.js (e.g., neutral grays with a single accent color).

Set up globals.css to apply base Tailwind styles.

3. Landing Page (app/page.tsx):

Design a simple yet elegant landing page with:

Hero Section: A catchy headline like "Your Personal AI Health Companion," a brief description, and "Get Started" and "Login" buttons.

Features Section: A concise overview of key features (Personalized Plans, Daily Tracking, AI Mental Wellness, Symptom Checker) with icons.

Call to Action (CTA): A final encouragement for users to sign up.

4. Authentication with Firebase:

Set up a new project in the Firebase console and enable Email/Password authentication.

Securely store your Firebase configuration keys in a .env.local file.

In lib/firebase.ts, initialize the Firebase app.

Create authentication pages within an (auth) route group in the app directory:

login/page.tsx: A login form with email and password fields.

signup/page.tsx: A signup form for name, email, and password.

Implement the signup and login logic using Firebase's createUserWithEmailAndPassword and signInWithEmailAndPassword functions. Upon success, redirect users to a /dashboard route.

Manage user sessions globally using a React Context provider and Firebase's onAuthStateChanged listener.

5. Root Layout (app/layout.tsx):

Create a root layout that incorporates a modern font (e.g., Inter from Google Fonts) and applies the global styles to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application."
